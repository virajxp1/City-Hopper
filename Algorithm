Get user input - run userinput script
Create a look up table that connects cities to numbers
example: austin to london paris and munich return to austin
    Austin = 1 London = 2 ... lookup table will help us assign cities to array indicies

Take the user inputed cities and run the scraper for each combination over all dates - store this in main - call this price_master
    the format of this is a 4d matrix where pricemaster[i][j] points to another matrix of flight objects across a date range
    ie say u want pricemaster of austin to london - that points to another matrix where the columns are dates and the rows are all the flights for that date

Take the user inputed cities and run the distance finder script -call this distance_master
    the format of this is a 2d matrix where distance_master[i][j] is the distance between city i and city j i,j are numbers that correspond to cities based on lookup table

Now we want to create our graph
    We will use an adjacency matrix since our graph is fully connected and directional - call this matrix graph
    graph[i][j] == the cost of going from i to j
    to calculate cost we run weighted function script passing in 2 paramaters distance_master price_master
    weighting function will call another function that will take the price master and average it accordingly
        Basically we are reducing the 4d matrix down to a 2d matrix
        Now we have a 2 2d matricies we do a weighted average based on our specified weights for both distance and price
        This results in a Graph to our liking
    Return this graph

Now we have our graph we need to run a cheapest path algorithm (Not Djkstras bcos it doesnt apply) probably a mincost algorithm so use prims/kruskals algorithm or maxflow algorithm so ford-fulkerson
Shortest path algorithm will spit out to us an array with an order so for example [Austin,London,Paris,Munich,Austin] - Austin is both the Source and Sink node here
Now we have an order we simply look up the flights that corresponds to this order and spit it out with all the information that goes along with the flight
Done :)
Now make it a front end application lul
